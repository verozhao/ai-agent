## 🧠 Agent Intelligence Features

### 1. **Chain of Thought Reasoning**
```python
# Example reasoning process
context = {
    "document_type": "complex_invoice",
    "confidence": 0.65,
    "anomaly_score": 0.8
}

decision = await agent.think(context)
# Agent reasons through:
# 1. What is the goal?
# 2. What actions are available?
# 3. What are likely outcomes?
# 4. Which action best achieves the goal?
# 5. What could go wrong?
```

### 2. **Continuous Learning**
- Agents learn from every decision outcome
- Success rate tracking and strategy adaptation
- Pattern recognition improves over time
- Collective learning shared across agent network

### 3. **Proactive Behavior**
- Agents identify when users might need help
- Suggest optimizations based on usage patterns
- Alert on potential issues before they occur
- Check in on long-running processes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-agent-doc-system
cd ai-agent-doc-system

# Start the entire system
docker-compose -f docker-compose.agents.yml up

# The system will be available at:
# - Main API: http://localhost:8000
# - Conversational Interface: http://localhost:8001
# - Expert Interface: http://localhost:8002
# - Monitoring Dashboard: http://localhost:8003
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/agent-deployment.yaml

# Scale agents based on load
kubectl scale deployment ai-agent-extractors --replicas=10
```

## 💬 Conversational Interface Examples

### Processing Documents
```
You: "Hey, I need to process this invoice"
Agent: "I'd be happy to process your invoice. I see you've uploaded 'invoice_2024.pdf'. 
        I'll start processing it right away. Based on my analysis, this appears to be 
        a complex multi-page invoice, so I'll use our advanced extraction strategy."

You: "How long will it take?"
Agent: "For this type of document, processing typically takes 2-3 minutes. I've assigned 
        our best extraction agent to handle it. I'll notify you as soon as it's complete.
        Would you like me to prioritize this?"
```

### Getting Insights
```
You: "What patterns have you noticed in my documents?"
Agent: "I've analyzed your recent document processing patterns and found some interesting insights:

1. **Document Types**: 65% invoices, 20% contracts, 15% reports
2. **Anomaly Trends**: Decreasing from 12% to 7% over the past month
3. **Processing Efficiency**: Improved by 23% after recent feedback
4. **Common Issues**: Date formats in European invoices often need correction

Would you like me to create a detailed report or adjust our processing strategies?"
```
